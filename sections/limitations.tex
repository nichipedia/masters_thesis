\section{Limitations}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
All datasets used in this project were aggregated from external studies.
These studies may have accuracy deficencies, and many were incomplete.
The accuracy can not be addressed, and the incomplete values were either interpolated or filled with defaults.
This is a important limitation, but is also good to highlight that better data will only improve the results from this work.

This work used spatial grids at ~2 minute resolution.
This was done because of time and resource limitations.
High resolution spatial grids are very large datasets.
The computing resources needed to process the required grids at higher resolutions went out side the phesable scope of this work.
However, grids at a higher resolution is more desired than 2 minute resolution.
Specifically, 30, 15, and 5 second resolution grids.
THe work preformed at 2 minute will scale to the higher resolution grids with sufficent computing resources.
