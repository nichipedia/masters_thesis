\section{Problem Statement}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}

Sea floor topography is monumentally important for Earth's natural processes and mankind.
It influences ocean circulation, helps moderate Earth's climate, and effects the biological diversity of the sea \cite{kunze2004role}.
Accurate mapping of sea floor topography is also of great interest to national defense \cite{goodman1982defence}.
With applications in \ac{ASW}, \ac{MIW}, and the entire Naval Fleet.
Along with being important to the shipping and commercial maritime industries.

\par
Depisite the importance of sea floor topography to all which has been listed.
Mankind has made much better maps of other planets, moons, and asteroids than Earth's sea floor \cite{becker2009global}.
Earth's oceans are vast and deep making accurate bathymetry measurement techniques like \ac{SDB} impossible for the majority of the ocean.
Unknown sediment composition and other environmental features limit the global accuracy of gravitational regression models to ~200 meters.
As of 2009, it is estimated that ~90 percent of Earth's oceans remains inaccurately mapped at a high resolution \cite{becker2009global}.

\par
Therefore, improving exsisting bathymetry prediction techniques is of great interest to many domains.
Coastal predictions can be preformed at very high accuracies, but are unable predict depths greater than ~50 meters.
Previous works as described in the Literature Review chapter have improved exsisting physics models using aggegation, optimization, and \ac{ML}.
Each work is based upon improving the exsisting physics model.

\par
In this work, I present a novel approach to predicting bathymetry using \ac{ML}.
My approach is based on using a set of ocean features to train a model for predicting bathymetry.
This differs in that my work is not based on improving a exsisting model, but using the \ac{ML} pipeline to create a model for prediction.
This work centers around three approaches used for prediction.
The first being a set of linear regression models compare to exsisting \ac{EGM}s.
Second a set of classification models using binned classes.
The third approach being a novel model created for this experiment.
I call it the "Grid Optimized" Bathymetry Classification Model.
