\section{Problem Statement}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}

Sea floor topography is monumentally important for Earth's natural processes and mankind.
It influences ocean circulation, helps moderate Earth's climate, and effects the biological diversity of the sea \cite{kunze2004role}.
Accurate mapping of sea floor topography is also of great interest to national defense \cite{goodman1982defence}.
With applications in \ac{ASW}, \ac{MIW}, and the entire Naval Fleet.
Along with being important to the shipping and commercial maritime industries.

\par
Despite the importance of sea floor topography to all which has been listed.
Mankind has made much better maps of other planets, moons, and asteroids than Earth's sea floor \cite{becker2009global}.
Earth's oceans are vast and deep making accurate bathymetry measurement techniques like \ac{SDB} impossible for the majority of the ocean.
Unknown sediment composition and other environmental features limit the global accuracy of gravitational regression models to ~200 meters.
As of 2009, it is estimated that ~90 percent of Earth's oceans remains inaccurately mapped at a high resolution \cite{becker2009global}.

\par
Therefore, improving existing bathymetry prediction techniques is of great interest to many domains.
Coastal predictions can be preformed at very high accuracy's, but are unable predict depths greater than ~50 meters.
Previous works as described in the Literature Review chapter have improved existing physics models using aggregation, optimization, and \ac{ML}.
Each work is based upon improving the existing physics model.

\par
In this work, I present a novel approach to predicting bathymetry using \ac{ML}.
My approach is based on using a set of ocean features to train a model for predicting bathymetry.
This differs in that my work is not based on extending a existing physics model, but using the \ac{ML} pipeline to create a model for prediction.
Initially, this work centered around fitting a regression model for predictions.
However, initial experiments and analysis indicated other approaches to be worth attempting.
This lead to three different approaches being tested in this work.
The first being a set of linear regression models intended to be compared to existing \ac{EGM}s.
Second a set of classification models using binned classes.
The third approach being a novel model created for this experiment.
I call it the "Grid Optimized" Bathymetry Classification Model.
