\section{Optimized Grid Model}
The Optimized Grid Model is a structure devised in this project to leverage locally efficent models.
This model is built upon the idea that there is not a optimal single model for predicting all of the worlds bathymetry.
It leverages several different models to predict bathymetry in a area by recording the best preforming models across a grid.
This allows the model to use the optimal model for predicting bathymetry.
