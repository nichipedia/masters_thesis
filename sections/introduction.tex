\section{Introduction}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
The forefront in global bathymetry mappings are aggregations of predicted and measured sources. 
These \ac{EGM}s are the standard for measuring global bathymetry \cite{becker2009global}\cite{smith1994bathymetric}\cite{smith1997global}\cite{smith2010planning}.
While sonar platforms such as the Multi Beam Echo Sonar (MBES) \cite{farr1980multibeam} are the most accurate measurements of seafloor depth.
It is not cost and time effective to collect large swaths of \ac{MBES} bathymetry measurements.
\ac{EGM}s use satellite altimeter data to create gravitational models for predicting bathymetry at a fraction of the cost and time.
In general, these models predict bathymetry with a error of 190 meters \cite{jena2012prediction}.

There has been much work using satellite altimeter derived gravity to predict bathymetry.
However, the work in this paper focuses on using ocean features derived from other studies as predictors.
The goal being to create a model that can predict bathymetry using many ocean features.
In this work I introduce an approach for optimizing model selection, feature selection, and conclude with evidence that a \ac{ML} model trained on ocean features is effective at predicting bathymetry.
