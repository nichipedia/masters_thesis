\section{Introduction}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
The forefront in global bathymetry mappings are aggregations of predicted and measured sources. 
These \ac{EGM}s are the standard for measuring global bathymetry \cite{becker2009global}\cite{smith1994bathymetric}\cite{smith1997global}\cite{smith2010planning}.
While sonar platforms such as the Multi Beam Echo Sonar (MBES) \cite{farr1980multibeam} are the most accurate measurements of seafloor depth.
It is not cost and time effective to collect large swaths of \ac{MBES} bathymetry measurements.
\ac{EGM}s use satellite altimeter data to create gravitational models for predicting bathymetry at a fraction of the cost and time.
In general, these models predict bathymetry with a error of 190 meters \cite{jena2012prediction}.

There has been much work using satellite altimeter derived gravity to predict bathymetry.
However, this work focuses on demonstrating the potential applications of \ac{ML} for predicting bathymetry.
The goal is to identify new potential approaches to predicting bathymetry.
I contribute to this domain by experimenting with regression and classification models fit to ocean feature data.
These experiments leading to a novel prototype model and a set of future experiments for predicting bathymetry.
