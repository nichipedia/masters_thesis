%Maybe reword this opening chapter???
The regression results showed that the feature space had correlations that could lead to accurate predictions.
Classification models were trained to test the advantages leveraged by classification models.
All bathymetry values were binned into classes at 150m intervals.
Validation is preformed using a 10 cross fold validation using balanced accuracy at the measurement.

\subsection{Classification Results Discussion}
The Random Forest model preformed excellently with a balanced accuracy of 82\%.
Breaking down the results by class the classifier predicted some classes with greater precission than others.
This is indicative that the model responded to certain trends in the data.
