\section{Conclusion}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
This study experimented with the viability of a \ac{ML} model for predicting global bathymetry and whether there was a best fit model for predictions.
Using predicted bathymetry and ocean features as training data the models were fit and analyzed.
This work concluded with evidence that there is not a best fit model or method for predicting bathymetry.
Using dynamic selection techniques to optimize across geophysical locations will lead to stronger models.
This was shown using a simple model selection to boost the performance of classifiers.
Analyzing the research performed in this paper it can be conjectured that combining optimized \ac{ML} models, \ac{EGM}s, and potentially undiscovered models may lead to highly accurate prediction models.
