\section{Conclusion}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
This study has experimented with three different experiments for predicting bathymetry with \ac{ML}.
Each experiment has improved upon the previous based on observations and analysis of the problem space.
Demonstrating that using a dataset of ocean features for building a model can be successful.
Improving the accuracy of these models will rely on access to accurate and complete ocean feature datasets.
Potentially, there are features not yet identified that could help with predictions.
In the future, iterating on features, models, and selection will lead to highly performant models.
