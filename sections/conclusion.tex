\section{Conclusion}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
This study experimented with the viability of a \ac{ML} model for predicting global bathymetry.
Using predicted bathymetry and ocean features as training data the models were fit and analyized.
This work concluded there is not a best fit model or method for predicting bathymetry.
Using dynamic selection techniques to optimize across geophysical locations will lead to stronger models.
This was shown using a simple model selection to boost the performance of classifiers.
Analyizing the research performed in this paper it can be conjectured that combining optimized \ac{ML} models with accurate \ac{EGM}s could lead to highly accurate prediction models.
