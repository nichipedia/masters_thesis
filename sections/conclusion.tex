\section{Conclusion}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
Machine Learning is a hot topic in todays world.
This paper explored the potential application of \ac{ML} for predicting global bathymetry, as well as, determining if there was evidence for a best fit model.
Many models were fit and compared leading to the determination that \ac{ML} can potentially create viable models.
However, limited access to accurate bathymetry and feature data temper expectations.
On the other hand, this paper found there to not be a best fit model for predicting global bathymetry. 
Figure \ref{fig:coveragegrid} shows evidence that models are more accurate dependent on location.
In conclusion, there is not a best fit model for predicting global bathymetry.
