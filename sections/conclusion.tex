\section{Conclusion}
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
Machine Learning is a hot topic in academia.
This paper explored the potential application of \ac{ML} for predicting global bathymetry, as well as determining if there was evidence for a best-fit model.
Many models were fit and compared leading to the determination that \ac{ML} can potentially create viable models.
However, limited access to accurate bathymetry and feature data temper expectations.
This paper found there to not be a best fit model for predicting global bathymetry. 
Figure~\ref{fig:coveragegrid} shows evidence that models are more accurate dependent on location.
In conclusion, while there is strong evidence that there is not a best fit global modal, \ac{ML} can help determine an appropriate model based on an arbitrary decision boundary.
