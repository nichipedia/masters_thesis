\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}
This work attempts to demonstrate that ocean features can be used to train a \ac{ML} model for predicting bathymetry.
Ocean features were aggregated from a set of studies and placed into ~2 minute spatial grids representing earths oceans.
A set of regression models, classification models, and a novel classification model for this were analyzed in this work.
The training of these models were preformed using bathymetry data from the ETOPO2v2 dataset.
The performance of each model was evaluated using the bathymetry from this dataset, and subsequent metrics were produced and displayed in this work.
Results demonstrate that ocean features can be used to build a successful prediction model for bathymetry.
These results being the first reported in this work.
