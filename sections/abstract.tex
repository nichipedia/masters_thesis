This work is concerned with the viability of \ac{ML} in training models for predicting global bathymetry, whether there is a best fit model for predicting bathymetry, and optimizing bathymetry predictions. 
The desired result is an investigation of the ability for ML to be used in future prediction models and to experiment with multiple trained models 
to determine an optimum selection. Ocean features were aggregated from a set of external studies and placed into two minute spatial grids representing 
the earth's oceans. A set of regression models, classification models, and a novel classification model were then fit to this data and analyzed. 
The novel classification model is optimized by selecting the best performing model in a geospatial area. This optimization increases prediction accuracy
for test purposes by approximately 3\%. 
These models were trained using bathymetry data from the ETOPO2v2 dataset. Analysis and validation for each model also used bathymetry from the 
ETOPO dataset, and subsequent metrics were produced and reported. Results demonstrate that ocean features can potentially be used to build a 
prediction model for bathymetry with the inclusion of accurate data and intelligent model selection. Based on the results in this work, evidence 
supports that no single model will best predict all Global bathymetry and choosing optimum models for areas will benefit prediction accuracy.
