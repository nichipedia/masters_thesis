This work is concerned with the viability of \ac{ML} for training models  for predicting global bathymetry, and whether there is a best fit model for predicting that bathymetry.
The desired result is a investigation of the ability for \ac{ML} to be used in future prediction models, and experimenting with multiple trained models to determine a optimumum selection.
Ocean features were aggregated from a set of external studies and placed into \~{}2 minute spatial grids representing Earth's oceans.
A set of regression models, classification models, and a novel classification model were then fit to this data and analyzed.
The novel classification model is optimized by selecting the best performing model in a geospatial area.
This optimization increases prediction accuracy for test purposes by approximately 3\%.
Training these models was performed using bathymetry data from the ETOPO2v2 dataset.
While analysis of each utilized the bathymetry from the ETOPO dataset, and subsequent metrics were produced and reported.
Results demonstrate that ocean features can potentially be used to build a prediction model for bathymetry with the inclusion of accurate data and intelligent model selection.
Based on the results in this work, there is evidence that no single model will best predict all Global bathymetry.
