This work experiments with training \ac{ML} models for predicting bathymetry.
The desired result being a demonstration of the ability for \ac{ML} to be used in future prediction models.
Ocean features were aggregated from a set of external studies and placed into \~{}2 minute spatial grids representing Earth's oceans.
A set of regression models, classification models, and a novel classification model were then fit to this data and analyzed.
Training these models was preformed using bathymetry data from the ETOPO2v2 dataset.
While analysis of each utilized the bathymetry from the ETOPO dataset, and subsequent metrics were produced and reported.
Results demonstrate that ocean features can be used to build a prediction model for bathymetry with the inclusion of accurate data and inteligent model selection.
