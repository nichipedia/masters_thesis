I would like to thank the UNO faculty of the Computer Science department for their stewardship over the past 3 years.
I have learned much from many of the professors and enjoyed my time as a graduate student.
Specifically, I want to thank Dr. Hoque for operating as my thesis advisor and providing excellent guidance.
He kept a considerate attitude throughout the process and was always eager to help.

I would like to thank Dr. Warren Wood of the Naval Research Laboratory, Ocean Sciences Division.
He has laid the groundwork for this thesis work as well as providing excellent guidance.

I would like to thank my co-scientists of the Naval Research Laboratory, Ocean Sciences Division. Specifically, Ben Stringer, Brittney Jarreau, Jenna Dauzat, Adam Minor, Elias Ioup, Norm Schoenhardt, and Bruce Lin.
They have given much of their personal time to give constructive critiques of my paper and methods.
As well as, offer excellent direction and suggestions for improving my results.
